# fluentd-humio
Fluentd Docker image that ships data to Humio

## Overview
This [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lucamora/fluentd-humio/) based on [fluentd](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluent/fluentd/) image is able to send Docker logs to [Humio](https://www.humio.com).

#### Outgoing log format
```json
{
	"message": "<CONTAINER_LOG>",
	"service": "<SERVICE_NAME>",
	"@type": "<HUMIO_PARSER>",
	"@container": "<YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>",
	"@shipper": "<SHIPPER_CONTAINER_ID>"
}
```
Where:
- `<CONTAINER_LOG>`: is the log generated by your app, read by Docker daemon and sent to the shipper in the `log` field
- `<SERVICE_NAME>`: is the name of your application configured on contianer creation ([see setup container](#setup-docker-container))
- `<HUMIO_PARSER>`: is the parser that Humio use to parse the log ([see setup shipper](#setup-shipper-container))
- `<YOUR_CONTAINER_ID>`: is the ID of your app's container generated by the Docker daemon
- `<SHIPPER_CONTAINER_ID>`: is the ID of the shipper container generated by the Docker daemon

## Setup shipper container
To run the shipper container, two environment variables must be set:
- `HUMIO_TOKEN`: Humio ingest token
- `HUMIO_PARSER`: parser used in Humio to parse logs generated by Docker container

The easiest method to run the shipper is to create a standalone Docker container.

#### Docker command
```bash
docker run \
-d \
-p 24224:24224 \
-e HUMIO_TOKEN=<INGEST_TOKEN> \
-e HUMIO_PARSER=<PARSER> \
--name shipper \
lucamora/fluentd-humio:1.0.0
```

Another way to run the shipper is to use the compose file (**suggested method**):

*This example assumes that a swarm has already been initialized*

#### docker-compose.yml file
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  shipper:
    image: lucamora/fluentd-humio:1.0.0
    deploy:
      mode: global
      restart_policy:
        condition: any
    ports:
      - "24224:24224"
    environment:
      HUMIO_TOKEN: <INGEST_TOKEN>
      HUMIO_PARSER: <PARSER>
```

#### Docker command
```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml humio
```

## Setup Docker container
To enable log shipping for a container some configuration has to be setup.
First the `--log-driver` option must be set to `fluentd`, then **two logging option** have to be configured with `--log-opt` and finally a `label` has to be defined to identify the log source in Humio dashboard.

The easiest method to configure the container is to run it in standalone mode.

#### Docker command
```bash
docker run \
--log-driver=fluentd \
--log-opt tag="docker.{{.ID}}" \
--log-opt labels="service" \
--label service=<SERVICE_NAME>
<YOUR_IMAGE>
```

Another way to configure the container is to use the compose file (**suggested method**):

*This example assumes that a swarm has already been initialized*

#### docker-compose.yml file
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: <YOUR_IMAGE>
    logging:
      driver: fluentd
      options:
        tag: docker.{{.ID}}
        labels: "service"
    labels:
      service: <SERVICE_NAME>
```

#### Docker command
```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml <STACK_NAME>
```

## Custom configuration
If you want to edit the configuration file without building your own image you can edit the [original file](https://github.com/lucamora/fluentd-humio/blob/master/fluent.conf) and then bind it into the Docker container using the `-v` option.

If you run your app in standalone mode:

#### Docker command
```bash
docker run \
... \
-v "path/to/your/fluent.conf:/fluentd/etc/" \
lucamora/fluentd-humio:1.0.0
```

Or if you use the docker-compose file

#### docker-compose.yml file
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  shipper:
    image: lucamora/fluentd-humio:1.0.0
    ...
    volumes:
      - "path/to/your/fluent.conf:/fluentd/etc/"
```
